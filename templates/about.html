                In this program based on lungs ct scan, Covid-19 results are predicted in real-time.
                We can perform a Quick Scan for single CT images that generates an immediate result.
                A scan can perform the test on a patient's CT image and store the result by creating
                and adding a patients database through which we can analyse the patient's history.
                The model that generates the prediction of the result is developed
                by using the Deep Learning Sequential CNN model and by using VGG16 Transfer Learning.
